        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Peanut butter cookies are one of my favorite cookies to make. They are the only peanut butter cookies my family will eat! Sprinkle a pinch of sugar on cookies before baking, if desired.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>>1 cup peanut butter</li>
            <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Mix peanut butter, sugar, and egg together in a bowl using an electric mixer until smooth and creamy.</li>
            <li>Roll mixture into 1-inch balls and place 1 inch apart on an ungreased baking sheet; flatten each with a fork, making a criss-cross pattern.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until edges are firm, about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Cool on the baking sheet briefly before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
        </ol>
